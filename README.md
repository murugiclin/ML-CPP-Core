# ML-CPP-Core

A lightweight C++ implementation of essential machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means clustering. This project is intended for educational purposes, offering clear and minimal code to demonstrate how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Features
- **Linear Regression**: Fits a line to data using the least squares method.
- **Decision Tree**: Implements a binary classification tree with Gini impurity-based splitting.
- **K-Means**: Clusters data points into k groups based on Euclidean distance.
- Example usage included in the main program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (C++11 or later)
- Standard Template Library (STL)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ML-CPP-Core.git
